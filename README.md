# wercker-step-gh-npm-release

a wercker step for deploying releases to github and npm.

## options

* `ghtoken` needs to be set to your github API token
* `npmtoken` needs to be set to your npm auth token
* `branch` specify the branch to push release commits and tags
* `packer` (optionally) set to an `npm` command that creates a `package.tgz` file in the same directory. when not set, `npm pack` is used for creating a tarball to publish
* `access` needs to be set to either public or restricted (if this is a scoped package)
* `repo` (optional) needs to be set when used with a service other than github
* `dryrun` (optional boolean) git push and npm publish steps are skipped when this option is set. you can use it for testing and debugging

## example

The following example shows how you can create an automation pipeline that,

* Merges changes from the `master`
* Updates the `package.json` file (on the specified `branch`) with the new version number according to semver spec
* Pushes a release commit to the specified release branch
* Creates a new git tag
* Publishes a new release on npm.

`wercker.yml`

```
box:
  id: acroyear2/karma-box:8.5.0

build:
  steps:
    - script:
        name: build
        code: |
          echo 42

publish:
  steps:
    - install-packages:
        packages: git ssh-client
    - wearereasonablepeople/gh-npm-release:
        ghtoken: $GHTOKEN
        npmtoken: $NPMTOKEN
        branch: release
        access: restricted
```

To set this up in the Wercker console, go to your application's `Workflows` settings:

Create `build` and `publish` pipelines.

Make sure that the `build` pipeline is hooked to git pushes and the `branch` you deploy the releases is ignored for this pipeline, otherwise you will run into an infinite release loop.

Your workflow should look like this:

```
+-----+              +-------+
|build| +----------> |publish|
+-----+              +-------+
(ignores release)    (runs only on master)
```

## Notes

* This will run the `build` command before publishing the npm release if it exists in your `package.json` file
* The release branch should always have the latest published version number in the `package.json` file.
